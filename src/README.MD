Simple React Blog
A clean, beginner-friendly blogging platform built with React, React Router, React Context, and Tailwind CSS.

Project Overview
This project demonstrates a basic blog website with:

Multiple pages and navigation using React Router.

Global posts state managed by React Context for easy sharing and updating of blog posts.

A Create Blog form to add new posts dynamically.

Listing of blog posts on the home page, showing title, excerpt, author, date, and category.

Responsive and clean styling with Tailwind CSS.

Why build this?
This app is great for learning core React concepts in a practical way, including component design, routing, state management, and styling.

Features
Home page: Displays all blog posts in a list or grid.

Create blog page: Form for users to submit new posts with validation.

Persistent header/footer: Navigation links available on all pages.

Dynamic post updates: New posts appear immediately after adding without page reload.

Category tags with colors: Highlight post categories with user-defined colors.

Project Structure

    Header.jsx            # Navigation header

    UserBlog.js           # Initial posts data (optional)
  App.js                  # Main app with routes and provider
  index.js                # Entry point
How It Works
The PostsContext holds the shared state of all blog posts.

The entire app is wrapped in <PostsProvider> to provide this state to every component.

CreateBlogs uses usePosts() to add new posts to the shared state.

HomeBlog uses usePosts() to read and display all posts.

React Router switches between pages without full page reload.

Tailwind CSS provides quick styling with utility classes.

Future Improvements
Persist posts in localStorage or connect to a backend API.

Add authentication for user-specific blogs.

Add search, filtering, and pagination for posts.

Improve UI/UX with animations and accessibility.
